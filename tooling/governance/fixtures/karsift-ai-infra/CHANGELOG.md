# Changelog

## 2026-08-25 — Recognize Cursor API-key phrasing without exposing stderr

- Live caller run `32839205119` still published `unspecified` after the bounded
  stderr path landed. A safe local reproduction showed Cursor phrases an
  invalid credential as `API key is invalid`, while the sanitizer recognized
  only the reverse word order `invalid API key`.
- Authentication classification now accepts the exact bounded Cursor phrase
  `API key is invalid`. Negative regressions reject unrelated help text that
  merely mentions an API key near expired, revoked, or invalid feature text.
  Raw text remains withheld and the artifact vocabulary is unchanged.
- Model bindings, parameter strings, exact-SHA review, artifact isolation,
  protected checks, and retry limits remain unchanged.

## 2026-08-25 — Classify empty-response Cursor failures from bounded stderr

- Live caller run `32836275599` proved the artifact handoff works, but the
  Cursor CLI exited nonzero with an empty JSON response and placed its
  diagnostic only on stderr, leaving the published bounded reason unspecified.
- The failed producer job now lets `extract-cursor-result.py` inspect at most
  64 KiB of its local stderr file and map recognizable text to the existing
  allowlisted reason codes. Oversized, missing, or unrecognized input remains
  `unspecified`; the option is invalid unless a failure record is requested.
- Raw stderr never enters annotations, artifacts, comments, or job outputs.
  Exact-SHA binding, clean App-token publication, role mappings, parameterized
  model strings, protected checks, and retry limits remain unchanged.

## 2026-08-25 — Hand off bounded reviewer failures through artifacts

- Live caller run `32828138123` proved GitHub did not expose step/job outputs
  from the failed reviewer job to its downstream publisher; the publisher was
  skipped even though the model step had reached terminal failure.
- Reviewer and plan-reviewer failure handlers now write a strict schema-v1 JSON
  record containing only the allowlisted reason and regex-bounded subtype, then
  upload it with a one-day retention. Dedicated clean publisher jobs download
  and revalidate that record before minting the narrowly scoped App token.
- Failure publishers no longer depend on outputs from a failed job. Exact live
  PR base/head and reusable-workflow SHA binding, non-verdict separation, raw
  provider-output withholding, role mappings, and retry limits remain intact.

## 2026-08-25 — Publish bounded reviewer failures from an isolated runner

- Historical note: merge `21a24db` introduced a step-output handoff that the
  later live run above proved unavailable after the producer job failed. It is
  superseded by the bounded artifact handoff.
- Cursor result extraction exposed only regex/allowlist-constrained
  `failure_subtype` and `failure_reason` step outputs after terminal invocation
  failure; raw provider response text and stderr remain withheld.
- Reviewer and plan-reviewer jobs passed those bounded values to dedicated clean
  publisher jobs. Each publisher checked out the exact reusable-workflow SHA,
  validates the live PR base/head pair and bounded vocabulary, mints the App
  token only after validation, rechecks identity, and posts a non-verdict
  infrastructure-failure comment.
- Successful verdict publication, role mappings, parameterized models,
  exact-SHA review binding, protected checks, and retry limits are unchanged.

## 2026-08-25 — Emit Cursor workflow-command annotations on stdout

- `config/extract-cursor-result.py` now writes only its sanitized
  `--github-annotation` workflow command to stdout, the channel GitHub Actions
  parses for annotations; ordinary non-annotation diagnostics remain on stderr.
- Subprocess regressions assert the exact stdout/stderr boundary for both a
  classified provider error and a missing response file. Raw provider output,
  paths, and credentials remain withheld.
- Role mappings, model parameters, exact-SHA binding, protected checks, and the
  bounded retry limit are unchanged.

## 2026-08-25 — Require explicit Grok 4.6 effort in live Cursor identifiers

- Corrected planner, reviewer, and reviewer-retry bindings to
  `cursor/grok-4.6[effort=high,fast=false]`. Live Cursor CLI discovery and
  invocation proved the prior effort-omitted expression unavailable while the
  explicit high-effort Standard expression succeeds.
- `prepare_cursor_model.py` now rejects Grok 4.6 bindings that omit `effort`,
  preventing a syntactically valid but unavailable identifier from reaching a
  workflow invocation or silently selecting another model.
- Bounded failure classification now recognizes Cursor's allowlisted
  `Available models:` diagnostic as `model_unavailable_or_invalid` without
  publishing the model list or any raw provider output.
- Composer 2.5 and explicit high-effort non-Fast Grok 4.6 were both verified
  live; exact-SHA controls, protected checks, risk classification, and bounded
  retry limits are unchanged.

## 2026-08-25 — Publish bounded Cursor failure reasons as check annotations

- `config/extract-cursor-result.py` now supports a fail-closed
  `--github-annotation` mode that emits only its bounded subtype/reason
  diagnostic plus an explicit raw-output withholding notice.
- `review.yml` and `plan-review.yml` use that mode after their bounded Cursor
  retries fail, so the actionable sanitized reason survives as structured
  check metadata even though verdict publication correctly remains skipped.
- Raw Cursor stderr and provider response text remain withheld; role mappings,
  exact-SHA review binding, risk controls, protected checks, and retry limits
  are unchanged.

## Unreleased

- Routed all six governed roles through Cursor under VOC-117: Composer 2.5
  for implementation and its single escalation attempt, Grok 4.6 Standard
  for planning and implementation review, and Grok 4.6 Standard with explicit
  high effort for plan review. Added fail-closed validation that preserves
  quoted bracket parameters after removing only the `cursor/` prefix; missing
  Cursor credentials, malformed bindings, and unsupported prefixes cannot
  silently select another provider or model.

- Hardened VOC-117's live Cursor failure path after the first Grok 4.6 review
  invocation returned a nonzero, structured response without a usable verdict.
  Review and plan-review now classify only bounded reason codes from the JSON
  response and withhold raw provider stdout/stderr, so model availability,
  quota, rate-limit, authentication, and parameter failures are distinguishable
  without exposing prompts, credentials, or arbitrary provider text.

- Upgraded every reusable and self-CI checkout to the verified immutable
  `actions/checkout` v7.0.1 commit and its Node.js 24 runtime. Every checkout
  now disables persisted credentials; adoption configures its scoped write
  token explicitly, preserving App-token preference and the documented
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback without relying on version-specific Git config.
  Policy coverage rejects an outdated, floating, credential-persisting, or
  unsafe-fork checkout regression.

- Made checked adoption-roster merges delete their ephemeral head branches
  only after confirmed merge and through an exact-SHA lease. Adoption is
  serialized per plan authority; queued-but-unmerged and concurrently advanced
  refs remain fail-closed, while a ref removed concurrently by native cleanup
  is accepted only after an authoritative absence recheck. No-change
  reconciliation recovers interrupted post-merge cleanup only when the current
  ref exactly matches a uniquely proven merged roster PR. Deterministic policy
  tests keep roster and ordinary
  task/plan cleanup aligned while protected long-lived branches remain untouched.

- Made post-merge task completion fetch its authority identity from the live
  merged caller PR instead of the triggering event's stale body snapshot.
  Corrected-body failed-job retries now converge safely; the live identity must
  match both the immutable adopted roster at the reviewed base and newest
  App-signed exact-base/head PASS review. Mismatched or ambiguous bindings
  remain fail-closed, partial publication
  restores a missing post-marker close wake-up, and a timeline-proven complete
  retry is mutation-free.

- Allowed the live-evidence carrier publisher to normalize small, task-bound
  adopted-plan stubs that are explicitly pending but do not use the canonical
  carrier template. Completed, ambiguous, mismatched, malformed, and oversized
  evidence remains fail-closed, preventing a safe predeclared stub from
  stranding an operator-owned task as `untrusted_orphan_carrier`.

- Separated live-evidence workflow dispatch authority from App-authenticated
  repository mutations. Only the dedicated reconcile job receives a scoped
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` with Actions write access; the App no longer requests an
  unavailable Actions grant, and caller secrets are explicit.

- Canonicalized untrusted task- and plan-review narratives before constructing
  App-signed verification records. Full-line binding lookalikes are removed and
  replaced by the workflow's exact authoritative metadata, while malformed,
  duplicate, or non-final verdicts remain fail-closed.

- Made the clean implementation publisher's PR operations and bounded issue
  notifications explicitly target the calling repository. The isolated
  bare-repository job can now open or update a PR after pushing its verified
  bundle without depending on a checked-out Git worktree; a deterministic
  non-worktree fixture guards the recovery path.

- Restored schema-level rollout compatibility for `plan-review.yml` exact
  base/head inputs. Older default-branch callers can start unrelated issue
  events again, while omitted or invalid SHAs still fail closed before plan
  reviewer invocation.

- Replaced raw CI-log replay in remediation with allowlisted run/base/head/job
  metadata in the Actions summary. A CI-only retry now reproduces the failure
  with repository-controlled checks when no trusted signed review exists, so
  terminal sequences or arbitrary log content cannot break the retry decision
  or become durable PR/model context.

- Added `live-evidence-reconcile.yml`, a serialized, App-authenticated operator
  path that validates declared Actions metadata, records one sanitized result
  commit, forces fresh exact-SHA review, optionally dispatches only declared
  workflow inputs through a crash-safe trusted reservation, and escalates one
  72-hour timeout. Waiting provenance is correlated to the exact active caller
  pipeline run, and run candidates are paginated with a fail-closed bound. The
  operator token uses a pinned post-fix action revision that enforces the three
  requested repository permissions instead of inheriting the full installation.
  Pull-request evidence must name the waiting PR, Checks read permission is
  explicit, and dispatch revalidates the current PR body, latest trusted
  WAITING verdict, deadline, and immutable branch snapshots immediately before
  its single attempt.
  Reviewer WAITING comments bind package/task/authority metadata; only open,
  unmerged, unexpired tasks can dispatch; both compared branches must be
  protected; and structured comment values are single-line safe. Reviewer
  verdicts are now validated and signed by the dedicated GitHub App from a
  fresh publisher job; the model-facing reviewer and implementer hold no
  issue-writing token, so the generic Actions bot cannot forge dispatch
  authority. Merge, remediation, and plan adoption accept only those App-signed
  exact-head records and require the matching isolated publisher check; plan
  review uses the same separation.
  The caller template polls hourly instead of using a recursive catch-all
  `workflow_run` trigger.
- Isolated privileged publication from unrestricted implementation: the model
  job emits a credential-free Git bundle, while a fresh runner mints the scoped
  App token, verifies/imports the exact commit in a bare repository, disables
  hooks, applies an explicit branch lease, and opens or updates the PR.
  Model-authored workflow-file changes are rejected before push and the token
  has no workflows permission, preventing an unreviewed same-repository PR from
  becoming a secret-bearing execution path. Retry context accepts only the
  exact-head App-signed reviewer record and matching publisher check.
- Isolated privileged publication from unrestricted planning as well: the
  planner receives no persistent checkout credential and emits only a Git
  bundle or clarifying-question artifact. A fresh runner validates exact commit
  lineage and package-only scope before minting a repository-scoped App token,
  pushing the plan branch, and opening the draft PR or updating its source
  issue.
- Added dependency-free strict contract parsing and deterministic rejection,
  sanitization, lineage, staleness, timeout, dispatch, and deduplication tests.

- Added an exact-SHA `WAITING FOR OPERATOR LIVE EVIDENCE` review lifecycle:
  merge stays fail-closed, remediation does not spend an implementation retry,
  and genuine implementation/CI/reviewer failures retain their bounded retry.
  Superseded PR runs now cancel, stale runs cannot review/remediate a newer head,
  remediation retries enforce the failed head before model work and again with
  an explicit SHA-valued push lease, and merge atomically requires the head SHA
  whose gate passed. Callers must pass exact-head inputs; their reusable schema
  remains rollout-compatible, while omissions fail closed at runtime.
  Pull-request `closed` events no longer cancel the source run that merged them.
- Removed founder-comment merge authority: R0-R4 now share the same CI and
  exact-revision independent-verification gate when autonomous merge is enabled.
- Fixed plan adoption handoff by merging with the GitHub App token, autonomously
  recording adoption in the roster PR, and adding idempotent reconciliation for
  missed `pull_request: closed` events.
- Removed founder-comment release authority. Completed rosters promote through a
  checked PR automatically, with `reconcile-release` as the idempotent retry path.

Execution-mechanism history for `implement.yml`, `plan.yml`, and `review.yml` -
which CLI/action each role's "Run ..." step actually invoked, why it changed,
and what broke along the way. This is the *how it's invoked* history; for
*which model/vendor fills each role and why*, see `config/roles.yml`'s own
header comment, which is the single source of truth for that and is kept
current there, not duplicated here. Each workflow file itself now carries
only a short "current state" summary + a pointer to the relevant section
below - read this file for the full reasoning behind why the file looks the
way it does.

Extracted from those three files' own header/inline comments on 2026-08-08
(see that commit for exactly what moved) so the files themselves stay
readable as *current* documentation rather than an ever-growing narrative of
every past state.

## implement.yml

- **2026-07-23, restored to `openai/codex-action`**: once OpenAI API billing
  became available again, after an earlier same-vendor compromise (Claude
  Code CLI for both implementer and reviewer) that this replaced.
- **2026-07-24, same-vendor compromise (again)**: the Anthropic Console org
  behind `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was disabled (billing/account issue, not a
  karsift-ai-infra bug), with no fallback Claude access available, so
  reviewer/planner also moved to `openai/codex-action` - see `review.yml`'s
  own changelog section below for that side.
- **2026-07-25, mixed-vendor pilot, superseded 2026-07-26**: `implementer`
  moved to OpenCode (`opencode-go/kimi-k2.7-code`), after strong review-role
  evidence for that model (see `review.yml`'s 2026-07-25 entry below) -
  founder made the call anyway, on the theory review/analysis quality was a
  reasonable proxy for implementation quality; watched real CI/review pass
  rates to confirm. `implementer_escalation` deliberately stayed on
  `openai/codex-action` (`gpt-5.6-sol`) at first, as a genuinely different,
  strong fallback for the one retry that matters most - traded away
  2026-07-26 ("no more quota in codex") when it moved to `opencode-go/glm-5.2`,
  collapsing the file to a single real execution step. The `openai/codex-action`
  step was disabled (`if: false`), not deleted, kept as a one-line revert path.
- **2026-07-31, moved to Cursor**: the OpenCode Go account behind
  `OPENCODE_API_KEY` looked exhausted/degraded across every model tried the
  same day (see `review.yml`'s 2026-07-31 entry below for the specific
  live-evaluation evidence that surfaced this). Founder directive: move every
  role - implementer, implementer_escalation, reviewer, planner - to Cursor
  (a pre-existing Pro+ subscription), a different cost-effective model per
  role rather than one model everywhere. Base implementer and escalation now
  run through a single "Run implementer (cursor-agent)" step - only
  `config/roles.yml`'s `implementer` vs `implementer_escalation` values
  differ, not the CLI. The opencode and claude-code-escalation steps were
  disabled (`if: false`), not deleted, for the same one-line-revert reason.
- Every claim about the Cursor CLI's real flags/behavior in the current file
  was verified against the actually-installed CLI in a disposable sandbox,
  not assumed from fetched docs - see `review.yml`'s 2026-07-31 entry below
  for the specific checks (workspace-trust blocking, `--mode plan`'s real
  read-only guarantee, stdin prompt input avoiding the `execve()`
  argument-length limit, the single-JSON-object `--output-format json`
  shape) that were verified once and apply to every Cursor-CLI execution
  step across all three files.

## plan.yml

- **2026-07-24, same-vendor compromise**: rewritten from Claude Code CLI to
  `openai/codex-action` for the same Anthropic Console org outage described
  in `implement.yml`'s 2026-07-24 entry above - lower-stakes here since
  planner has no cross-vendor independence requirement the way
  implementer/reviewer do (planner output is a draft a human reviews, never
  something an independent AI verifier checks).
- **2026-07-25, OpenCode pilot**: rewritten a second time to a raw `opencode`
  CLI invocation (`opencode-go/qwen3.7-max`, later `glm-5.2` same day per
  founder follow-up - see `config/roles.yml` for the full model history).
  Uses OpenCode's built-in `build` agent (full read/write, same as
  `implement.yml`) since it needs to create real files, not the restricted
  read-only `reviewer` agent `review.yml` defines.
- **2026-07-26, misdiagnosed then corrected**: `glm-5.2` hung with zero
  progress dispatching a real package; briefly swapped to `kimi-k2.7-code`
  on the theory this was model-specific, but that hung identically. Root
  cause was neither model - the `OPENCODE_API_KEY` account's weekly OpenCode
  Go quota had run out, a hard cap that blocks the CLI indefinitely instead
  of returning a clean error (also why the workflow's own quota-fallback
  string-matching never caught it). Fixed at the credentials layer, not the
  model layer.
- **2026-07-26, restored to Claude Code**: founder follow-up same day ("use
  claude code as a planner, I remember we used to use it"). Rewritten back
  from `opencode run` to the Claude Code CLI (prompt via stdin, not `-p` as a
  CLI argument - avoids the same argv-length class of bug `review.yml`'s
  2026-07-31 entry documents for Cursor).
- **2026-07-31, moved to Cursor**: same founder consolidation directive as
  `implement.yml`'s 2026-07-31 entry - planner itself wasn't on OpenCode at
  the time (it was on Claude Code), so wasn't directly affected by that
  day's OpenCode-account incident, but moved anyway as part of the same
  "everything through Cursor" decision.

## review.yml

- **2026-07-24, same-vendor compromise**: rewritten from Claude Code CLI to
  `openai/codex-action` - same Anthropic Console org outage as
  `implement.yml`'s entry above. Explicit note at the time to revert once
  Claude access was restored (later superseded by the 2026-07-25 OpenCode
  pilot below, not reverted to Claude).
- **2026-07-25, OpenCode pilot, reviewer-only**: rewritten a second time from
  `openai/codex-action` to a raw `opencode` CLI invocation. Founder's
  explicit reason: cost - an existing OpenCode Go subscription ($10/month)
  unlocks `opencode-go/`-prefixed models without OpenAI's per-token pricing.
  No official reusable Action exists for one-shot `workflow_call` dispatch
  (OpenCode's own GitHub Action is built for interactive PR-comment
  mentions), so a raw CLI invocation was used instead.
  - Found live: `opencode run` (v1.18.5 at the time) has no `--permissions`
    or `--quiet` flag - an earlier version of this step assumed both existed
    (from an unreliable fetched-docs source - see `config/roles.yml`'s
    correction note about a fabricated pricing table from the same
    research pass) and every run hard-failed immediately. Real read-only
    enforcement ended up agent-based: a `reviewer` agent defined in a
    generated `opencode.jsonc` with explicit per-permission-key
    allow/deny, the OpenCode equivalent of `codex-action`'s `:read-only`
    profile.
  - This pilot was reviewer-only by explicit founder instruction -
    implementer/planner did not follow until later (see their own entries).
- **2026-07-31, moved to Cursor**: the OpenCode Go account behind
  `OPENCODE_API_KEY` looked exhausted/degraded live - every model on the
  account (including this role's own `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro`) either
  timed out or errored in a same-day bounded probe (VOC-032-T10's
  live-evaluation evidence), and the review job on a real PR was stuck ~30
  minutes with zero verdict as a direct result, not a one-off flake. Founder
  had a pre-existing Cursor Pro+ subscription ($60/month) - moved to the raw
  `cursor-agent` CLI.
  - Verified live before relying on any of it (`agent --version` reported
    `2026.07.23-e383d2b` at the time), in a disposable sandbox, not assumed
    from fetched docs - the same discipline the 2026-07-25 `--permissions`
    mistake above was meant to prevent repeating:
    - `--mode plan` is a first-class documented flag, not something built
      out of a generated permission-profile file - confirmed the CLI
      genuinely refuses file creation/deletion in that mode even when asked
      directly and plainly to use its tools.
    - A fresh working directory is workspace-untrusted by default and blocks
      waiting on an interactive trust prompt it can never receive
      non-interactively (same *class* of bug as the 2026-07-25 OpenCode
      permission-key hang above) - `--trust` is required every run for this
      reason, but only answers that one prompt; verified it grants no
      additional write permission on its own.
    - The prompt is piped via stdin, not passed as a positional argument -
      sidesteps the `execve()` `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` ("Argument list too long")
      crash a large real prompt (full diff + every package doc) would hit if
      passed as an argument.
    - `--output-format json` (non-streaming) is a single JSON object on
      stdout, not OpenCode's nd-JSON per-event stream.
  - implementer and planner followed to Cursor separately (see their own
    2026-07-31 entries) - this file's own execution step only ever covers
    the reviewer role.
